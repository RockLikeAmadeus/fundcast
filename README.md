Under construction...

Users should be able to
- View my current account balance today
	- Divided by individual accounts
	- Divided by envelopes
	- Total
- View all the above balances any day in the future based on my configuration
- Enter a recurring expense like a bill or debt payment, recurring by
	- Day
	- Month
	- Week
	- Other
- Enter a single future expense
- Enter a periodic budget, such as gas or groceries, that can be automatically spread out into the future over days, weeks, months, etc.
- Visualize account/envelope/total balances into the future on
	- Calendar
	- Graph
	- Scrollable list of dates
- A pre day view (for list or calendar) that displays
	- Total
	- Either, toggle-able
		- Account Balances
		- Envelope balances
- Ability to favorite accounts and envelopes to only view favorites
- Ability to enter a “potential” charge or recurring expense to see how it would affect future balances
- Ability to query a specific balance to see
	- Any points in the future at which a certain envelope/account/total will go under that balance
	- The maximum amount you would have to spend to go under that balance at some point in the future (and what date that would be)
- ability to set up balances that should show alerts on the dashboard

Advanced features
- Track debt accounts and debt payments (with interest payments, so you can determine payoff dates) (see Debt Management Tool).
- Forecast investment accounts based on estimated returns


So the different view should be:
- home page
	- date picker (default to today)
	- day’s balance (total, then by account or envelope eventually)
	- one time expense/purchase entry
	- visualization tools (charts, calendar)
	- envelope balances (eventually)
	- query button (see above)
- query view
- provisional view (for potential charges)
	- ability to apply changes
- calendar view
- scrollable list of dates view
- configuration view
	- Enter a recurring expense
	- Enter and configure a budget (this is different than an expense, i.e. for groceries, gas, etc. and lets you configure how it should be spread out i.e. every day, every 4 days, every week, etc.)
